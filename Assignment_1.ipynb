    "Imagine a chess computer. In traditional programming, a programmer would code in all the rules and strategies for the computer to play chess. AI, however, takes a different approach. An AI chess program might learn by playing millions of chess games against itself or other programs. Over time, it improves its own strategy and becomes a formidable opponent, without needing explicit instructions on every move.\n",

    "Machine learning is a type of AI where machines learn from data.  Say you're showing your vacation photos to a friend's phone.  A machine learning program  could analyze those photos and, without you telling it anything,  start identifying pictures on the beach, in the mountains, or with people in them. The more photos you show it, the better it gets at recognizing patterns and making these classifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### c) Deep Learning (DL)\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning is a powerful kind of machine learning inspired by the human brain. It uses artificial neural networks, which are like interconnected webs of information processing units.  Think of it as a complex web of knowledge.  Going back to our photo example, a deep learning system  could not only categorize your vacation photos but also start  recognizing specific objects in them,  like faces, animals, or landmarks, all through  learning from vast amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Here's a simple analogy to understand the relationship between these terms: Imagine AI as a broad field of creating intelligent machines. Machine learning is a specific approach within AI where machines learn from data. Deep learning is an advanced technique within machine learning that uses complex algorithms and neural networks."
