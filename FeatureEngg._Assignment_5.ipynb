    "Both ordinal encoding and label encoding convert categorical data into numerical representations for machine learning models. However, they differ in how they treat the order of the categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ordinal Encoding: Preserves the inherent order of the categories. It assigns numerical values that reflect the order (e.g., low = 1, medium = 2, high = 3). This is suitable for ordinal data where categories have a natural ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Label Encoding: Assigns unique integer labels to each category without considering order. There's no guarantee that higher numerical values represent \"better\" or \"worse\" categories (e.g., customer satisfaction: satisfied = 0, neutral = 1, dissatisfied = 2).

    "Target guided ordinal encoding takes a different approach to encoding categorical data compared to traditional methods. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Leveraging the Target Variable: It uses the target variable (what we are trying to predict) to inform the encoding of categorical features.\n",
    "2. Category Ranking: For each category within a feature, it calculates a statistic related to the target variable (e.g., mean, median). This essentially ranks the categories based on their average impact on the target variable.\n",
    "3. Numerical Encoding: Categories are then assigned numerical values based on their ranking. Higher values correspond to categories with a stronger association with a higher target variable value (depending on the problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Imagine you're predicting customer churn for a telecom company. \"Customer service level\" (bronze, silver, gold) is a categorical feature. Target encoding could:\n",
    "- Calculate the average monthly revenue for each customer service level.\n",
    "- Rank the levels based on average revenue (bronze -> low, silver -> medium, gold -> high).\n",
    "- Assign numerical values reflecting the ranking (e.g., bronze = 1, silver = 2, gold = 3).\n",
    "This way, the encoding captures the relationship between customer service level and churn (potentially, higher levels lead to lower churn).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "- When you suspect a relationship between the categorical feature and the target variable, and that order matters.\n",
    "- When dealing with ordinal data where the order might not be perfectly linear, but there's still a trend.              \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Target encoding can lead to data leakage if used for training and validation sets derived from the same data. Techniques like K-Fold cross-validation can mitigate this."

One-hot encoding creates separate binary features for each category (e.g., \"is_high_school\", \"is_bachelors\", etc.), avoiding assumptions about equal intervals between levels.
